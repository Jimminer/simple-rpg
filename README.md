# simple-rpg
A project I started with my friend @Giratin. It's nothing more than a simple rpg game written in Python.

# Actions
The current working actions are: Find available shops

# Configuration
The shops and items are configurable.
The item prices are not stable. They have a set price that does fluctuate upon going to a shop.

# To-do
- Add more shops/items (Giratin)
- Add more actions (me)
- Add a currency system (me)
- Add quests/adventures (me + Giratin)
- Add character menu (me)
- Add a more player friendly UI
- Add classes
